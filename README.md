## Job Recommendation for Stack Overflow users
### GoalÂ¶
Stack Overflow users can be ranked based on the number of questions they answer and the cumulative scores for all their answers. The goal is to recommend jobs for a specific user by building a profile strength for that user. The profile strength for a user can be determined using characteristics of users such as their skills, answers they gave and user "About Me" information.
